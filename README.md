# Vernaculize
Vernaculize is a learning and education-focused Android app that helps users learn and memorize words from various languages. In this app, users are presented with words from the language that they want to study and are required to translate those words into English. For example, if the word shown is "Hola!", the user must type "Hello" in order to get it correct. This app's goal is to facilitate better comprehension, better pronunciation, and improved fluency of languages for users. The app is also very customizable, accessible and tries to make the learning process more fun and engaging for users. 

- Uses dictionary API (https://dictionaryapi.dev/) for dictionary feature
- Uses random word API (https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home) for randomized word feature.
- Uses Google Translate MLKit for translation
- Uses Google Text-to-Speech Engine for text-to-speech feature. 
- Has a hint feature that displays the first two letters or characters of a word. 
- Gives the users the ability to change text-to-speech voice.
- Gives the users the ability to change pitch and speed rates.
- Gives the ability to change the tested languages (English, Spanish, Italian, German, Chinese)
- Has a daily progress goal (Study 7 words a day)
- Tracks the number of words the user has learned and tracks the accuracy and proficiency of the user and their answers.
- Randomly gives a list of words that the user got incorrect in order for them to review them. 
- Has a give-up button that displays the answer to the user.
- Has a winning streak counter. 
- Lets the user be able to type their answer into a textbox. 

With more time, these are the features I would've liked to implement into this project:
- Point System, Achievements, and Leaderboard System (Focus on gamification of the app) 
- User Registration (Database implementations)
- More accessibility features (Color-blind friendly, adjustable font size, screen magnification, dyslexia-friendly features and voice commands and gesture support, etc)
- Quiz or Test feature (Multiple Choice Questions)
- Machine Learning for Personalized Recommendations of words a user needs to study 
- Give users access to learning materials (Videos, study guides, language learning websites, etc)
- Competitive Aspect (Play against an AI or CPU player with various difficulties) 
- Add more languages to support.
- Use better human-computer interaction techniques to improve the user experience.
